# SVAR_tools
Structural VAR (SVAR) toolbox for bayesian VAR estimation and a range of identification methods. Now also includes OLS identification with wild boostrap errors.

Update 02/16: added AIC lag selection, weak-IV test F statistic, and auto-plotting function in RunMain_monetaryIVautoplot.m

Allows multiple identifications: 
* Spectral and Limited Spectral restrictions - identifying the shock that maximizes the share of variance in a desired frequency band - see [Dieppe, Francis, and Kindberg-Hanlon 2021 (JEDC)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188921001512) and [Dieppe, Francis, and Kindberg-Hanlon 2021 (ECB Working Paper)](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2534~2383e60ba4.en.pdf?eeffb1db5c1033da86491dbc6c96ce9a)
* The long-run restriction of Blanchard & Quah 1989/Gali 1999
* The Max Share approach of Francis et. al. 2014
* A Cholesky identification.
* Sign and zero restrictions
* Restrictions on the share of FEVD explained by the different shocks.
* IV identification


The bayesian VAR function outputs:
* Impulse responses (IRFs)
* Forecast error variance decompositions (FEVDs)
* Historical decompositions
* Structural shock series

Full examples are provided.

## Long-run and Max Share restrictions
The file *RunMain.m* estimates a VAR consisting of US labor productivity, employment, investment and consumption as a share of GDP, inflation, and long-term bond yields. It then demonstrates how to estimate a technology shock using the Spectral, Limited Spectral, long-run, and Max Share restrictions and plots them side by side.


## Sign, zero, and relative FEVD contributions
The file *RunMain_signandzero.m* estimates a VAR consisting of US labor productivity, employment, inflation, and long-term bond yields. It then demonstrates a method of identifying a technology shock, demand shock, monetary policy shock, and a supply shock using sign and zero restrictions. It also demonstrates how to impose FEVD magnitude restrictions. For example, technology shocks are assumed to have a larger share of the variance of labor productivity at the 5 year horizon, while demand shocks are assumed to dominate the FEVD of labor productivity in the first year. This is for demonstrative purposes rather than for any particular theoretical reason.

## IV identification
The file *RunMain_monetaryIV.m* estimates a VAR consisting of the US one-year treasury rate, log core CPI, log IP, log consumption, the unemployment rate, log C&I lending volumes, and corporate spreads. It then demonstrates a method of identifying a monetary policy shock using the Gertler and Karadi (2015) and Miranda-Aggrippino and Ricco (2021) instruments. It does not use a bayesian estimation, but rather standard OLS with the wild bootstrap method of obtaining error bands. Bayesian sampling methods are not valid with IV. However, the BootVAR method used to estimate the VAR in this file can also be used with other methods of identification instead of the Bayesian VAR used in the other example files.
